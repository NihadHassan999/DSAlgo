'''
You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
Example 2:

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.

-> create hashset and res with l = 0
-> iterate indices through len(s) and add count and find maxf
-> if length - maxf > k, then remove current first pointer value from count and increment first pointer position
-> finally return substring length

class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        count = {}
        l = maxf = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            count[s[r]] = 1 + count.get(s[r], 0)
            maxf = max(maxf, count[s[r]])

            if (r - l + 1) - maxf > k:
                count[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1

        return (r - l + 1)
