Reverse a Linked List
Given the beginning of a singly linked list head, reverse the list, and return the new beginning of the list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [0,1,2,3]

Output: [3,2,1,0]
Example 2:

Input: head = []

Output: []
Constraints:

0 <= The length of the list <= 1000.
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev, curr = None, head

        while curr:
            next_node = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next_node
        return prev
