'''
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.
'''
#1) use two pointers to traverse (sorted is advantage)
#2) find curr sum using curr pointers
#3) if currsum is less than target, left pointer increment
#4) if currsum is greater than target, right pointer decrement

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l, r = 0, len(numbers) - 1

        while l < r:
            currSum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
            if currSum > target:
                r -= 1
            elif currSum < target:
                l += 1
            else:
                return [l + 1, r + 1]
        return []
