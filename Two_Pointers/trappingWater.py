'''
Trapping Rain Water
You are given an array non-negative integers height which represent an elevation map. Each value height[i] represents the height of a bar, which has a width of 1.

Return the maximum area of water that can be trapped between the bars.

Example 1:



Input: height = [0,2,0,3,1,0,1,3,2,1]

Output: 9
Constraints:

1 <= height.length <= 1000
0 <= height[i] <= 1000
'''

'''
-> create left and right pointers max and final result
-> if left height < right height, then increment l and get max and vice versa
-> finally return result
'''

class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        leftMax, rightMax = height[l], height[r]
        result = 0

        while l < r:
            if leftMax < rightMax:
                l += 1
                leftMax = max(leftMax, height[l])
                result += leftMax - height[l]
            else:
                r -= 1
                rightMax = max(rightMax, height[r])
                result += rightMax - height[r]
        return result
